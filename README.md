Created a prototype and design for accessing NHS health records and GP's. The problem space we were tackling was the lack of access to health records and the usage of GP time wasted on social interaction for small issues, which could be dealt with over text. The reason this seems relevant is that GP's are free in the UK so skipping hassle for both sides would be great.
